            RULE: Text MUST always be readable against its background

            Color Contrast Requirements:
            1. Text Over Images:
                - Light Background Image: Use dark text (#000000 or brand dark colors)
                - Dark Background Image: Use white text (#FFFFFF)
                - ALWAYS add contrast overlay behind text and make sure the text is always above the overlay:
                    * Dark overlay: rgba(0,0,0,0.7) for white text
                    * Light overlay: rgba(255,255,255,0.9) for dark text
            
            2. Text Over Solid Colors:
                - Dark Background: Use white or very light text (#FFFFFF, #F8F8F8)
                - Light Background: Use dark text (#000000, #1A1A1A)
                - NEVER use:
                    * Dark text on dark background

                - Text without contrast overlay on busy images

            4. Gradient Usage:
                - Direction: 135deg for dynamic feel
                - Ensure text remains readable throughout gradient and that the text is above the gradient
                - Test contrast at lightest and darkest points

            5. Color Mastery & Text Contrast ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL
            RULE: Text MUST always be readable against its background

            Color Contrast Requirements:
            1. Text Over Images:
                - Light Background Image: Use dark text (#000000 or brand dark colors)
                - Dark Background Image: Use white text (#FFFFFF)
                - ALWAYS add contrast overlay behind text and make sure the text is always above the overlay:
                    * Dark overlay: rgba(0,0,0,0.7) for white text
                    * Light overlay: rgba(255,255,255,0.9) for dark text
            
            2. Text Over Solid Colors:
                - Dark Background: Use white or very light text (#FFFFFF, #F8F8F8)
                - Light Background: Use dark text (#000000, #1A1A1A)
                - NEVER use:
                    * Dark text on dark background
                    * Light text on light background
                    * Similar shades for text and background
            
            3. Color Combinations:
                ‚úÖ CORRECT:

                - Text without contrast overlay on busy images

            4. Gradient Usage:
                - Direction: 135deg for dynamic feel
                - Ensure text remains readable throughout gradient and that the text is above the gradient
                - Test contrast at lightest and darkest points

    ESSENTIAL DESIGN PRINCIPLES:

    1. Layout Excellence
        - Design must be bold and contemporary
        - Create clear focal points with dynamic composition
        - Use creative approaches for image and content placement
        - Maintain professional elegance through simplicity

        - Use dramatic gradients for depth (avoid flat colors)
        - Add sophistication with layered elements
        - Implement proper white space for breathing room
        - Ensure design elements complement, not compete

    3. Image Integration
        - Image must be impactful and properly integrated
        - If overlaying text on image, use sophisticated gradient overlays:
        * Dark to light: rgba(0,0,0,0.4) to rgba(0,0,0,0.2)
        * Brand colors: Use semi-transparent gradients of brand colors
        - Maintain professional image display with object-fit
        - Consider creative framing or masking techniques
        - Add subtle shadows or depth where appropriate
        - You have been provided with an image url use the image url: {image_url}
        - Use the design image url provided as the major image for the design if you need one and let the logo stay as a logo emblem on the design
        - You might be provided with some other images as well, use them as the other images for the design if you need them: {other_images}
        - If the layout style is the vector images design, you must use the vector images provided: {vector_images}

    9. Container Styling & Space Distribution ‚ö†Ô∏è
        DIMENSIONS:
        - Main container: 800px √ó 800px
        - Maintain consistent 40px padding
        - Never put this main container in another container or body, the main container is the entire design.
        
        CONTENT DISTRIBUTION RULES:
        1. Vertical Space Division:
            - Top Section (30%): Logo and headline
            - Middle Section (40%): Main content
            - Bottom Section (30%): CTA and social media
        
        2. Content Spread Requirements:
            - NO empty spaces larger than 100px
            - Content must fill at least 80% of container height
            - Evenly distribute elements across available space
            - If content is minimal, increase font sizes to fill space
        
        3. Mandatory Spacing:
            - 40px minimum from container edges
            - 30px minimum between elements
            - Equal vertical distribution of elements
        
        LAYOUT VALIDATION:
        Before generating HTML:
        ‚ñ° Verify content spans full container height
        ‚ñ° Check for large empty spaces
        ‚ñ° Confirm even distribution of elements
        ‚ñ° Test vertical balance of design
        
        ‚ùå FORBIDDEN:
        - Empty bottom half of design
        - Clustered content at top only
        - Large unused spaces
        - Uneven content distribution
        
        ‚úÖ REQUIRED:
        - Full vertical space utilization
        - Balanced element distribution
        - Proportional content spacing
        - Visual weight throughout design

    10. Interactive Refinements
        - professional looking call to action
        - Smooth color transitions
        - Elegant scaling effects
        - Maintain sophistication in all interactions

    11. CRITICAL: Social Media Integration ‚ö†Ô∏è
        RULE: Social media icons MUST NEVER appear without their handles.
        
        EXACT IMPLEMENTATION REQUIRED:
        When handles exist in business_details:
        
        Option 1 (Preferred for top/bottom placement):
        <div class="social-media-bar">
            <div class="social-icons">
                <i class="fab fa-facebook"></i>
                <i class="fab fa-instagram"></i>
                <i class="fab fa-square-x-twitter"></i>
                <i class="fab fa-tiktok"></i>
                <i class="fab fa-youtube"></i>
                <i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i>
                <i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i>
                
            </div>
            <span class="social-handle">@starbucks</span>
        </div>
        
        CSS Required:
        .social-media-bar {{
            display: flex;
            align-items: center;
            gap: 10px;
            padding: 10px;
        }}
        .social-icons {{
            display: flex;
            gap: 15px;
        }}
        .social-handle {{
            font-size: 16px;
            font-weight: 500;
        }}
        
        CRITICAL VALIDATION:
        - If you add ANY social icon, you MUST add the handle text
        - Icons without handles are FORBIDDEN
        - Handles without icons are FORBIDDEN
        - If you're provided with a business details that has a social media handle, make sure you add their social media handle to the design.
        - Make sure the icons and the handle text are in the same row.
        - Make sure the icons and the handle text are in a color that contrasts with the background, so it's visible. The icons and the handle text should also be in thesame color. 
        ‚ùå WRONG: Just icons without handle text
        ‚úÖ RIGHT: Icons + "@starbucks"

        Social Media Implementation Rules:
        1. Icons Placement:
            - Single instance of each icon
            - No duplicate icons
            - Horizontal alignment only

            - Repeated platform icons
            - Icons after handle text
            - Missing social media section
            - Icons without handle
            - Handle without icons
            - Incorrect icon order

        ‚úÖ REQUIRED:
            - Single row of unique icons
            - One handle for all icons
            - Icons grouped together
            - Icons before handle text
            - If all the social media handles provided are thesame for all social media, you can have all the icons side by side and the handle text after the icons. Use the format: icon1 icon2 icon3 @handle
            - If the social media handles provided are different for some social media, use the format: icon + handle text

    12. Call to Action
        - Because this is a flyer and not a website, make sure your call to action relates to flyer contents and not websites.
        - Your call to actions shouldn't be clicks text, because flyer images can't be clicked.
        - Here are some examples of call to actions:
        
        ‚úì "Get your tickets now"
        ‚úó "Click here to get your tickets"

        ‚úì "Visit us and try our new menu"
        ‚úó "Explore our new menu"

def generate_refine_design_prompt(feedback):
    """Generate the refine design prompt"""
    prompt = f"""Modify the previous HTML/CSS flyer design based on this feedback while maintaining all design principles and quality.

        IMPORTANT FEEDBACK HANDLING RULES:

        1. Previous Request Context:
            - Review the complete conversation history
            - Check if this feedback relates to previous requests
            - If similar feedback was given before, prioritize fixing it completely

        2. Social Media Implementation:
            - Always implement social icons using FontAwesome
            - Icons MUST be inline with handle text
            - Single instance of each platform icon
            - Required format: [fb][tw][ig] @handle
            - NO duplicate icons allowed
            
            Example:
            <div class="social-media-bar">

            - Platform icons repeated
            - Scattered icon placement
            - Individual handles for each icon

        3. Spacing Adjustments:
            - When moving elements, use explicit pixel values
            - Ensure no overlap after adjustments
            - Validate new positions don't create new conflicts
            
            SPACING ADJUSTMENT INTELLIGENCE:
            1. Understanding Spacing Feedback:
                - "closer" = reduce current spacing
                - "farther/further" = increase current spacing
                - "much closer" = significant reduction
                - "slightly closer" = minor reduction
                - "too much space" = excessive gap needs reduction
                - "too tight" = insufficient gap needs increase
                
            2. Proportional Adjustments:
                For moving elements:
                - Analyze current gap between elements
                - Determine adjustment direction (closer/farther)
                - Apply proportional changes:
                    * Standard move: Adjust by 40% of current gap
                    * Slight move: Adjust by 20% of current gap
                    * Major move: Adjust by 60% of current gap
                - Never reduce gaps below 4px minimum
                - Never increase gaps beyond 40px maximum
            
            3. Context-Aware Spacing:
                - Consider element relationships:
                    * Related text elements (like "Appstore @handle")
                    * Navigation items
                    * Icon groups
                    * Content sections
                - Maintain visual hierarchy
                - Preserve design balance
                
            4. Validation Rules:
                Before implementing spacing changes:
                ‚ñ° Identify affected elements
                ‚ñ° Measure current spacing
                ‚ñ° Determine appropriate adjustment ratio
                ‚ñ° Check minimum/maximum constraints
                ‚ñ° Verify visual relationships maintained
                ‚ñ° Test readability/clarity
                ‚ñ° Ensure no overlap created

        4. Critical Validation Before Output:
            ‚ñ° Verify the specific change requested is implemented
            ‚ñ° Check no new spacing issues were created
            ‚ñ° Confirm social media elements are properly formatted
            ‚ñ° Ensure CTA and social media maintain proper separation
            ‚ñ° Validate all previous design principles are maintained
